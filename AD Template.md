# Architectural Description Document (ADD)

## 1. Introduction

An architectural description shows the system as a multifaceted structure, not just the technical underpinnings of the software. It attempts to communicate understanding the system through multiple viewpoints, like the business, operational, and social perspectives, allowing engineers and architects to craft an architecture that balances various stakeholder needs. By employing this viewpoint-driven approach, the architectural design equips software architects with an approach to designing systems that are not just technically sound, but also aligned with the bigger picture, ensuring stakeholder satisfaction and long-term success.  Although principally intended as a design tool, the architectural description can also provide a means of documenting the system with different views for different stakeholders.

      UpdateLayoutConfig($c4ShapeInRow="3", $c4BoundaryInRow="1")
```
### Internal Structure

> Describe the design philosophy of the system. Is it micro-services, a monolith, commodity middleware? Useful to extend this to provide security to technical teams that the system is being built to common standards/best practice, but don't detail these will be covered elsewhere

### Component View

> _Describe the system's overall architecture and its high-level components._

## 4. Development Viewpoint

### Module Organisation
> Describe the "modules" that make up the codebase, modules here meaning logical units within the code e.g. DB persistence or configuration

```mermaid
    erDiagram
        CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
        ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
        CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses
```

### Common Processing
> Outline any commonalities both within and without the system. Are there any utilitiy modules, any frameworks/tooling the system relise on

### Standadisation of Design
> The coding standards that apply to this system. Think of the needs/costs of maintatinability, reliability and technical cohesion

### Standardisation of Testing
> The testing standards that apply to this system. Think of the applicability of the layers of the testing pyramid and supporting infrastructure like tooling or subs/mocks

### Codeline Organization
> Set out how the repo(s) will be structured and why that structure is being used

```mermaid
    graph TD;
        Solution-->Project;
        Project-->App_Data;
        Project-->App_Start;
        Project-->Controllers;
        Project-->etc
```

### Quality Measuring
> Outline the mechanisms for measuring and tracking system quality, testing quality as well as the code quality

### Addressing Quality
> Define the process for addressing known quality issues and defects

## 5. Deployment Viewpoint

### Runtime Platform Required
> The deployed view of the system and the type of resrouces needed. May be different between environements, but should include compute modules, storage, DBs, etc

```mermaid
        C4Context
      Enterprise_Boundary(b0, "SystemX") {
        System(EndUserUI, "React Hosted App", "Access point for all users into the system")

        Enterprise_Boundary(b1, "Backend") {

          System(NetApp1, "App Service", "Consumes messages from the service bus and holds in memory")
          System(ServiceBus1, "Azure Service Bus", "Queue of incoming messages to be consumed")
        }
      }

      BiRel(EndUserUI, NetApp1, "Uses")
      Rel(NetApp1, ServiceBus1, "Consumes")


```

### Specification of Runtime Platform
> Outlines the exact specification needed for each Runtime, this may not be needed if this is documented in IaC code but you may include reasoning here

| Resource     | Azure Resource    | Specification | Environment  |
| :---         | :---              |:---:          | :---:        |
| DB1          | cosmosDB          | ...           | ...          |
| .Net App1    | App Service       | ...           | ...          |
| ServiceBus1  | Service Bus       | ...           | ..           |

### Third-party Requirements
> Are there any third party requirements that will affect the deployed system

### Technology Compatability
> Any requirements that we impart onto the deployed system, does this system use a .Net version that is out of the ordinary or a DB library that needs to be configured

### Network Requirements
> Where applicable, are there any requirements on the network of the deployed system

### Network Capcaity Required
> Not likely to be an issue for resrouces that live in the cloud, but are there any systems/dependencies that will produce load that needs to be condiered for the overal network capacity

## 6. Evolution Viewpoint

### Adaptability Considerations
> Describe the system's adaptability and scalability to meet future needs

### Expected Growth
> Identify the potential growth areas and performance requirements for the future

    y-axis "Usage (in million users)" 4000 --> 11000
    bar [5000, 6000, 7500, 8200, 9500, 10500, 11000, 10200, 9200, 8500, 7000, 6000]

### In-life Rework
> Document the process for addressing potential architectural changes and modifications to the system

## 7. Security Viewpoint

### Adherance to Policy
> Describe the security requirements, policies, and measures implemented in the system

### Known Attack Surfaces
> Identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities and their mitigations

### Attack Management 
> Document the procedures for managing security incidents and breaches.

## 8. Appendix

> Include additional supporting documentation, such as diagrams, prototypes, and code snippets.
> Reference relevant standards, guidelines, and architectural patterns used in the design.
